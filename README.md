> **Abstract:** Scene context prediction, which seeks to infer unknown contextual information from isolated object properties, currently faces limitations due to predominant reliance on pixel-wise supervision that overlooks real-world context priors. To address this, we present ContX, a context-prior-driven, coarse-to-fine model. ContX distinctively integrates explicit linguistic-contextual knowledge in two key ways. First, it proposes a linguistic guided context bank, leveraging linguistic-statistical contextual data to guide the rationality of segmentation shapes and foster meaningful inter-class contextual interactions. Second, ContX augments contextual comprehension by correlating layouts with linguistic descriptions, enhancing layout perception through a multi-modal strategy. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate ContXâ€™s superiority and versatility, outperforming current state-of-the-art methods in both qualitative and quantitative assessments.
